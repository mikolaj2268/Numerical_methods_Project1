# Numerical_methods_Project1

This project was a part of Numerical Methods University course. 
The task of the project was as follows:


Project No. 1: Simpson's method for approximating the value of the integral $$\int_{a}^{b} w_n(x) \,dx$$ where $w_n$ is a polynomial represented in the basis of Chebyshev polynomials of the second kind:
$$w_n(x) = \sum_{k=0}^{n} a_kU_k(x)$$
